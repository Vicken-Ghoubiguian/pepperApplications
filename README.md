This school has a humanoid robot known as Pepper. Initially manufactured and marketed by the French company Aldebaran robotics, the production and marketing of Pepper was taken over by the Japanese company Softbank when the latter acquired Aldebaran robotics. Here is an image of this robot so emblematic of humanoid robotics:

IMERIR uses the Pepper robot as the school mascot during various trade shows, meetings and professional forums focused on computer technologies and robotics as well as geek culture. 
As shown in some photos below, the Pepper robot from IMERIR is emulated wherever it goes.
